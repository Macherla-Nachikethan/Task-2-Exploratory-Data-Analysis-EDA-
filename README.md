# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
AI AND ML intern elevate labs
Objective: Understand data using statistics and visualizations.
Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Hints/Mini Guide:
    1. Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.).
    2 . Create histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
    3. Use pairplot/correlation matrix for feature relationships.
    4. Identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.
    5. Make basic feature-level inferences from visuals.
Learned: Data visualization, descriptive statistics, pattern recognition.

1. Importance of EDA
**EDA helps you understand the data before building any models.
**Summary Statistics
2.Using .describe(), .mean(), .median(), etc. gives a quick idea of:
**Data spread (standard deviation)
**Central tendency (mean, median)
**Possible outliers (min/max). It reveals patterns, relationships, missing values, and outliers.
3. Visualization Skills
Histograms → To check distributions (Age, Fare)
Boxplots → To detect outliers and understand spread
Barplots → To compare categories (like Pclass, Sex)
Correlation matrix → To see how features are related
Pairplot → To visualize multiple relationships quickly
